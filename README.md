# BM Analysis


Use mininconda and the environment.yml file to create a conda environment with all the dependencies:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

Activate the environment:

```conda activate bm_analysis```

To download the data, you'll need a `config.ini` file in the root directory with the following format:

```
[bmrs]
api_key = <your api key>
```

## How it works
