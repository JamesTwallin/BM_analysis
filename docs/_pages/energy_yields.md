## What's an energy yield?
Energy yields with wind farms refer to the amount of electrical energy that can be produced by a wind farm over a given period, usually a year.

Before a wind farm is built, pre-construction yield assessments are performed to determine the energy yield of the wind farm. Pre-construction yield assessments are used to inform the design of the wind farm and to determine the economic viability of the project. After some time has passed and the wind farm has been operating for a number of months, the energy yield of a wind farm can be assessed using real operational data. This is called a post-construction yield assessment, and it helps to highlight where losses are occuring and provide a more accurate picture of the energy yield of the wind farm. Alongside many other techniques, it helps wind farm owners understand their assets and make informed decisions about their operation.

## The scary plot

At first glance, it looks quite shocking how much energy (as a proportion of annual production) is being wasted by some wind farms in Scotland:

But if you look at the totals in the context of the actual yield, the numbers are a large percentage of a small number. The plot below shows what the typical year's production is for each wind farm that I've been able to find data for. The wind farms are sorted by their annual energy yield, with the largest wind farms at the top. Can you see a theme?

## Which means that the total energy lost is not that much
